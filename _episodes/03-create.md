title: "Working With Files and Directories"
teaching: 25
exercises: 10
questions:
- "How can I create, copy, and delete files and directories?"
- "How can I edit files?"
objectives:
- "Create a directory hierarchy that matches a given diagram."
- "Create files in that hierarchy using an editor or by copying and renaming existing files."
- "Delete specified files and/or directories."
keypoints:
- "`cp old new` copies a file."
- "`mkdir path` creates a new directory."
- "Most files' names are `something.extension`. The extension isn't required, and doesn't guarantee anything, but is normally used to indicate the type of data in the file."
- "`mv old new` moves (renames) a file or directory."
- "`rm path` removes (deletes) a file."
- "Use of the Control key may be described in many ways, including `Ctrl-X`, `Control-X`, and `^X`."
- "The shell does not have a trash bin: once something is deleted, it's really gone."
- "Depending on the type of work you do, you may need a more powerful text editor than Nano."

We now know how to explore files and directories,
but how do we create them in the first place?
Let's go back to our `data-shell` directory on the Desktop
and use `ls -F` to see what it contains:

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ ls -F
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
creatures/  data/  molecules/  north-pacific-gyre/  notes.txt  pizza.cfg  solar.pdf  writing/
~~~
{: .output}

Let's create a new directory called `thesis` using the command `mkdir thesis`
(which has no output):

~~~
$ mkdir thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}

As you might guess from its name,
`mkdir` means "make directory".
Since `thesis` is a relative path
(i.e., doesn't have a leading slash),
the new directory is created in the current working directory:

~~~
$ ls -F
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
creatures/  data/  molecules/  north-pacific-gyre/  notes.txt  pizza.cfg  solar.pdf  thesis/  writing/
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Two ways of doing the same thing
> Using the shell to create a directory is no different than using a file explorer.
> If you open the current directory using your operating system's graphical file explorer,
> the `thesis` directory will appear there too.
> While they are two different ways of interacting with the files,
> the files and directories themselves are the same.

{: .callout}

Since we've just created the `thesis` directory, there's nothing in it yet:

~~~
$ ls -F thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Let's change our working directory to `thesis` using `cd`,
then run a text editor called Nano to create a file called `draft.txt`:

## TODO:  Figure out good default text editor and update accordingly

~~~
$ cd thesis
$ nano draft.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

{: .callout}

Let's type in a few lines of text.
Once we're happy with our text, we can press `Ctrl-O` (press the Ctrl or Control key and, while
holding it down, press the O key) to write our data to disk
(we'll be asked what file we want to save this to:
press Return to accept the suggested default of `draft.txt`).

![Nano in Action](../fig/nano-screenshot.png)

Once our file is saved, we can use `Ctrl-X` to quit the editor and
return to the shell.

{: .callout}

`nano` doesn't leave any output on the screen after it exits,
but `ls` now shows that we have created a file called `draft.txt`:

~~~
$ ls
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
draft.txt
~~~
{: .output}

Now let's tidy up the `thesis` directory by removing the draft we created:

~~~
$ rm draft.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

This command removes files (`rm` is short for "remove").
If we run `ls` again,
its output is empty once more,
which tells us that our file is gone:

~~~
$ ls
~~~
{: .language-bash}

> ## Deleting Is Forever
>
> The Unix shell doesn't have a trash bin that we can recover deleted
> files from (though most graphical interfaces to Unix do). In other words,
> **if you remove (`rm`) something, it's gone forever!** 
> When we delete files in bash, they are unhooked from the file system so that
> their storage space on disk can be recycled. Tools for finding and
> recovering deleted files do exist, but there's no guarantee they'll
> work in any particular situation, since the computer may recycle the
> file's disk space right away.
{: .callout}

Let's re-create that file
and then move up one directory to `/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell` using `cd ..`:

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell/thesis
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ nano draft.txt
$ ls
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
draft.txt
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ cd ..
~~~
{: .language-bash}

If we try to remove the entire `thesis` directory using `rm thesis`,
we get an error message:

~~~
$ rm thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
rm: cannot remove `thesis': Is a directory
~~~
{: .error}

This happens because `rm` by default only works on files, not directories.

To really get rid of `thesis` we must also delete the file `draft.txt`.
We can do this with the [recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion) option for `rm`:

~~~
$ rm -r thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}

>
> ~~~
> $ rm -r -i thesis
> rm: descend into directory ‘thesis’? y

> rm: remove directory ‘thesis’? y
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> This removes everything in the directory, then the directory itself, asking
> at each step for you to confirm the deletion.
{: .callout}

Let's create that directory and file one more time.
(Note that this time we're running `nano` with the path `thesis/draft.txt`,
rather than going into the `thesis` directory and running `nano` on `draft.txt` there.)

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ mkdir thesis
$ nano thesis/draft.txt
$ ls thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
draft.txt
~~~
{: .output}

`draft.txt` isn't a particularly informative name,
so let's change the file's name using `mv`,
which is short for "move":

~~~
$ mv thesis/draft.txt thesis/quotes.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The first argument tells `mv` what we're "moving",
while the second is where it's to go.
In this case,
we're moving `thesis/draft.txt` to `thesis/quotes.txt`,
which has the same effect as renaming the file.
Sure enough,
`ls` shows us that `thesis` now contains one file called `quotes.txt`:

~~~
$ ls thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
quotes.txt
~~~
{: .output}

One has to be careful when specifying the target file name, since `mv` will
**silently overwrite any existing file with the same name**, which could
lead to data loss. Just as for `rm`, you can use an additional flag, `mv -i` (or `mv --interactive`),
to make `mv` ask you for confirmation before overwriting.

Just for the sake of consistency,
`mv` also works on directories

Let's move `quotes.txt` into the current working directory.
We use `mv` once again,
but this time we'll just use the name of a directory as the second argument
to tell `mv` that we want to keep the filename,
but put the file somewhere new.
(This is why the command is called "move".)
In this case,
the directory name we use is the special directory name `.` that we mentioned earlier.

~~~
$ mv thesis/quotes.txt .
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The effect is to move the file from the directory it was in to the current working directory.
`ls` now shows us that `thesis` is empty:

~~~
$ ls thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Further,
`ls` with a filename or directory name as an argument only lists that file or directory.
We can use this to see that `quotes.txt` is still in our current directory:

~~~
$ ls quotes.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
quotes.txt
~~~
{: .output}

{: .challenge}

The `cp` command works very much like `mv`,
except it copies a file instead of moving it.
We can check that it did the right thing using `ls`
with two paths as arguments --- like most Unix commands,
`ls` can be given multiple paths at once:

~~~
$ cp quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt
$ ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
quotes.txt   thesis/quotations.txt
~~~
{: .output}

To prove that we made a copy,
let's delete the `quotes.txt` file in the current directory
and then run that same `ls` again.

~~~
$ rm quotes.txt
$ ls quotes.txt thesis/quotations.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
ls: cannot access quotes.txt: No such file or directory
thesis/quotations.txt
~~~
{: .error}

This time it tells us that it can't find `quotes.txt` in the current directory,
but it does find the copy in `thesis` that we didn't delete.

### Nelle's Pipeline: Organizing Files

Knowing just this much about files and directories,
Nelle is ready to organize the files that the protein assay machine will create.
First,
she creates a directory called `north-pacific-gyre`
(to remind herself where the data came from).
Inside that,
she creates a directory called `2012-07-03`,
which is the date she started processing the samples.
She used to use names like `conference-paper` and `revised-results`,
but she found them hard to understand after a couple of years.
(The final straw was when she found herself creating
a directory called `revised-revised-results-3`.)

> ## Sorting Output
>
> Nelle names her directories "year-month-day",
> with leading zeroes for months and days,
> because the shell displays file and directory names in alphabetical order.
> If she used month names,

> November ('11') would come before July ('7'). Similarly, putting the year first
> means that June 2012 will come before June 2013.
{: .callout}

Each of her physical samples is labelled according to her lab's convention
with a unique ten-character ID,
such as "NENE01729A".
This is what she used in her collection log
to record the location, time, depth, and other characteristics of the sample,
so she decides to use it as part of each data file's name.
Since the assay machine's output is plain text,
she will call her files `NENE01729A.txt`, `NENE01812A.txt`, and so on.
All 1520 files will go into the same directory.

In the current directory `data-shell`, you can see what files
Nelle has by using the command:

~~~
$ ls north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03/
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Don't forget that you can use Tab completion to make this easier and quicker!
